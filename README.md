# C-Infinite-Runner

We designed a videogame using C++, which is the industry standard for developing games. While most modern game engines (2d and 3d) are written in that language, our 2d game was built using the SFML library. It stands for Simple and Fast Multimedia Library. It is an efficient and easy way to use C++ and develop graphic applications.

We have designed an infinite run and jump game where the goal of the player is to stay on one side of the screen and dodge obstacles that are coming their way by jumping over them. The main goal of the game is to survive the longest and attain the highest score possible. The game mechanics are simple and easy to understand and people of all ages can learn to play the game in a very short amount of time.
